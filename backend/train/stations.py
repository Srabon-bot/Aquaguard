"""Single source of truth for the 30 virtual gauge stations used across the
whole training pipeline (ingest_openmeteo_historical.py, ingest_discharge.py,
ingest_gfms.py, build_dataset.py, train_model.py, app/models/flood_gbm_model.py,
app/services/ffwc.py).

Expanded from the original 6 (Jamuna/Brahmaputra + Surma only) to 25, then to
30, on 2026-08-07, after the user asked for full-Bangladesh coverage. See
MODEL_BUILD_PLAN.md Part 1/2 for the "~20-25 stations" sizing rationale
(FFWC itself runs ~90-100+ gauges with 54 carrying official danger levels;
25 was chosen as a practical target that touches every major river system
without the diminishing returns of over-densifying a satellite/reanalysis
-based "virtual gauge" approach, where nearby points on a coarse model grid
don't add much unique signal the way independent physical gauges would) and
DECISIONS.md SS7 for why 5 more (coastal, storm-surge-exposed) were added
on top of that to reach 30.

Coordinates are real-town/known-confluence-point approximations, same
caveat as the original 6: "verify against the official FFWC station list"
before treating these as precise gauge locations -- they're accurate enough
for basin-level rainfall/discharge/flood-label extraction, not necessarily
the exact pixel a real gauge sits at.

Previously this station list was duplicated across every ingest_*.py file
(worked around app/'s import not resolving when scripts run directly from
train/, see ingest_discharge.py's old docstring) -- consolidated here once
so adding station #26 later means editing one file, not four.

basin values are used to group stations for two things:
  1. app/data/districts.json-style basin labeling (brahmaputra/ganges/meghna/cht)
  2. which UPSTREAM_BOXES entry build_dataset.py / ingest_openmeteo_historical.py
     use to compute upstream-catchment-mean rainfall for that station

# hand_m = "Height Above Nearest Drainage" -- a well-established,
# peer-reviewed flood-susceptibility metric (Nobre et al. 2011): vertical
# distance from a point down to its nearest stream/drainage cell, computed
# via proper hydrological flow-routing by MERIT Hydro's own authors. Chosen
# over manually computing a Topographic Wetness Index (TWI) ourselves --
# TWI needs slope and flow-accumulation area at matching resolutions
# (HydroSHEDS' DEM and flow-accumulation layers are at different native
# resolutions), and getting that resampling subtly wrong would be worse
# than using an already-correct, purpose-built metric for the same idea
# (both aim to capture "how prone is this location to water accumulation,"
# HAND does it more directly for flood risk specifically -- see
# DECISIONS.md SS17/SS18).
#
# MERIT Hydro's `upa` (upstream drainage area) band was ALSO sampled but
# deliberately excluded here: it came back ~0 km2 for most of our stations
# even on major rivers (e.g. SW90/Bahadurabad on the Jamuna) -- our station
# coordinates are real-town approximations, not pixel-exact channel
# centerlines, and `upa` is only meaningful on the exact channel cell,
# unlike `hnd` which stays sensible for a point near-but-not-on the
# channel. Included `elv` (raw elevation) alongside hand_m since it's a
# simple, standard static flood-relevance feature in its own right.
